          Edyta has been teaching Yoga for children with special needs in my classroom for two years.
          We are working in a special school, so it is very important to have teachers like Edyta.
          She is brilliant, calm, creative, positive and she is always supporting us with our more
          challenging pupils through her yoga session. Thanks Edyta.

          Edy helped Gracie during the various lockdowns with yoga classes. Every session was so personal and
          well organised specifically for Gracie and her needs. The tools provided for each session and as a
          takeaway from each lesson helped Gracie to focus so much better during such a difficult time. Edy was
          also able to adapt to Gracies needs easily and every session was amazing fun!

          My son, now 25, has severe learning difficulties, hemiplegia, and other mobility issues.
          He can exhibit behaviours of distress. He has been having regular weekly yoga sessions with Edy
          for 14 months now. He always looks forward to them, always makes sure he is ready, and is always 
          calm and happy after the sessions. We have noticed that he is more able to stretch his body and 
          limbs, and that his balance has improved. He also benefits hugely from the relaxation and 
          meditation elements of the sessions. They have become an essential part of his week.

          Heart with yoga was a wonderfully beneficial class for the students with complex additional
          needs. It grounded them, helping them to be present in the moment and bring self awareness to
          their own physical form. It was one of the few lessons where all the students would engage
          together as a group and it helped support their mobility and wellbeing.  I highly recommend!
