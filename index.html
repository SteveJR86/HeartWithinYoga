        Here at Heart Within Yoga, I believe yoga should be for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialise in Therapeutic Yoga for children and young adults with special needs.

      <p>
        In my Therapeutic Yoga sessions, I use sensory and visual aids and tools, modelling poses,
        social stories and games. I make adaptations and modifications based on age and cognitive, 
        social and emotional abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also teach Makaton signs yoga for nonverbal students.

      <p>
        My name is Edy, Iâ€™m a qualified yoga teacher offering Therapeutic Yoga for children and 
        young adults with special needs. I have years of experience working in Special Needs 
        settings. Throughout those years I have learned behaviour patterns and how to interact with 
        students. This experience allowed me to develop my unique Therapeutic teaching system. 
      </p>
      <p class="bigParagraph">
        I want to show you that yoga has no limits and everyone can practise it. Yoga is a unity of
        the body, the mind and the breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through practising yoga, I am eager to help others, especially those with additional needs, 
        to break the physical and mental boundaries together and to live life to the fullest! I am 
        passionate about what I do and seeing remarkable results with my students is the greatest 
        reward.

        <blockquote class="reviewText">
          My son, now 25, has severe learning difficulties, hemiplegia, and other mobility issues.
          He can exhibit behaviours of distress. He has been having regular weekly yoga sessions with Edy
          for 14 months now. He always looks forward to them, always makes sure he is ready, and is always 
          calm and happy after the sessions. We have noticed that he is more able to stretch his body and 
          limbs, and that his balance has improved. He also benefits hugely from the relaxation and 
          meditation elements of the sessions. They have become an essential part of his week.

          Heart with yoga was a wonderfully beneficial class for the students with complex additional
          needs. It grounded them, helping them to be present in the moment and bring self awareness to
          their own physical form. It was one of the few lessons where all the students would engage
          together as a group and it helped support their mobility and wellbeing.  I highly recommend!
